        <img src="images/jimmy.jpg" alt="Orange cat at the top of a cat tower" width="400">
        <p>Jimmy is a kitten that is full of playfulness and energy, but he still loves a good nap. He loves it even more if it's with his sister Rita. However, he will always wake up when there's treats.</p>
        <p>Jimmy loves to play with the other pets in the house. He quickly made friends with even the great dane who is more than triple his size.</p>

        <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
        <img src="images/bacon.jpg" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei" width="400">
        <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle.  He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him.  He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p>
        <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy.  He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride."  There is also a lot of rolling.  Lots and lots of rolling. </p>

        <h2>Jax</h2>
        <img src="images/Jax.jpg" alt="A black and white kitten sitting down and wearing a yellow collar." width="400">
        <p>Jax is a kitten, about five months old that I found this summer at a gas station while traveling to Marquette, Michigan. He was scared and malnourished, crying in the parking lot. I took him with me and after some healthy meals and a trip to the vet he is doing great!</p>
        <p>My roommates and I just recently moved and Jax has been having a hard time getting used to the large house since we were previously living in a small apartment. Jax is incredibly playful and loves to run around, but when he is sleepy he is happy to be held.</p>

        <h2>Leo</h2>
        <img src="images/Leo_primary_photo.jpg" alt="Guinea pig doing his best to smile for the camera" width="400">
        <p>Guinea pigs are a naturally energetic animal, who spend up to 20 hours a day awake. Despite being awake for long periods of time, they naturally hide in their habitats, and can be difficult to see in their inclosures.  Guinea pigs naturally are social creatures that enjoy socializing with other guinea pigs, in the wild they form packs of five to ten.</p>
        <p>Leo is a half-lazy, half-lively guinea pig that either likes to run around on the floor, doing tiny hops, or likes to lay down in the cage for hours at a time nibbling at hay. His favorite hobby is eating, and he can tell whenever someone is about to give good to him by waiting at the end of the cardboard box patio he has attached to his cage.</p>

        <h2>Chief</h2>
        <img src="images/chief.jpg" alt="Pomeranian looking at camera with head bowed" width="400">
        <p>Chief is a 9 year old pomeranian who loves to sleep as much as he can. He naps anywhere, ranging from someone's bed to the grass outside. He enjoys walking outside, but keep watch of him, otherwise he will try to consume geese poop.</p>
        <p>He does not like any toys anymore as when he was younger, he watched a bigger toy shred his favorite one to pieces. He used to know how to roll over, but now replaced that memory with a spin as it is much easier.</p>

        <h2>Riley</h2>
        <img src="images/riley_primary.jpg" alt="Apricot goldendoodle wearing blue bandana lying next to ball" width="400">
        <p>Riley is a 2yr old goldendoodle. He is very active and loves attention. Riley can be pretty mischievous; as such, his favorite activity is begging for (or stealing) food, however getting cuddled on a cool floor comes as a close second. In addition, Riley loves to walk in his local park or hang out with his best friend Cosmo.</p>
        <p>Riley would NOT survive in the wild. He is very stubborn, jealous, and pampered. He’s currently in his “terrible twos,” and must get everything his way. That said, Riley is loved by his family as a perfect, funny, and loyal dog. </p>

He likes going out on walks anytime of the day except when it is thunder storming, he will be running around the house trying to find a place to hide.</p>
        <p>After every walk, Oreo will always get the zoomies, or he will want to play fetch. He has a set schedule everyday where he likes to eat early morning around 9am and at night at 7pm. Oreo is a very high maintenance dog who needs a lot of attention but will give you all the love and kisses.</p>
